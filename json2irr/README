These scripts run on the IRRd instance which is supposed 
to load the ARIN WHOIS data.

The irr_rpsl_check must be available (ships with IRRd v3)

The Makeflie process is as following:

    - Fetch JSON file from NLNOG
    - Convert JSON file to IRR
    - Use irr_rpsl_check to check the IRR candidate for syntax errors and canonicalize the formatting
    - Move files into appropiate places
    - Send a signal to IRRd to reload the database (signal-load.bash)
